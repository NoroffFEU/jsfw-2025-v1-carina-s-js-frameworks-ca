# JavaScript Frameworks Course Assignment

This repository is under active development and the README is incomplete.

## Goal

Build a fully functional, responsive online shop using React or Next.js with TypeScript, demonstrating the ability to integrate APIs, manage state, apply software architecture principles, and justify framework choices in a real-world digital solution.

## Description

Build a fully functional online shop using React and Next.js. The app must fetch products from a REST API, display them in a user-friendly layout, provide product detail pages, implement search and sorting behaviour, and include a complete shopping cart and checkout flow. You must also create a validated contact form and ensure the full site works well on desktop and mobile.

The application allows users to:

- Browse a list of products
- View detailed information about each product
- Search for products from the homepage
- Add and remove items from a shopping cart
- Adjust quantities and view total cost
- Complete a checkout flow
- Send a message through a validated contact form
